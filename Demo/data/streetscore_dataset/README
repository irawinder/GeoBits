The dataset is made available in the form of a single .zip archive
which contains comma-separated value (CSV) files for each city. The
CSV files have three fields — latitude, longitude and q-score. You can
locate the image scored by StreetScore by querying the Google Street
View Image API using the (latitude, longitude) pair. q-score is the
perceived safety value for an image between -5 and 45 as predicted by
the StreetScore algorithm.
